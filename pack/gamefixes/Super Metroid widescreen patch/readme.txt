Super Metroid widescreen patch
2021-17-02, by ocesse

This folder contains a patch and a setting overrides file for Super Metroid (US+JP version).
To use those, copy both to the same folder as the ROM and rename them to the same name as the ROM (except for the extensions ".bps" and ".bso").

For RetroArch instead of the ".bso" file use the following settings:
WideScreen Mode: all
WideScreen Aspect Ratio: 16:9
WideScreen Background 3: below line 40
WideScreen Ignore Window: none
WideScreen Sprites: unsafe
CPU Overclocking: 120

The patch (the first of its kind) has been developed by ocesse. If you want to report issues, share ideas or just talk about widescreen patches join us on our Discord:
