Instructions
1.- You need Super Metroid (JU) [!] (UH).smc (CRC32: D63ED5F8)

Be sure that your game, the Widescreen bps patch and the bso override configuration file have the same name, for example:
Super Metroid (JU) [!] (UH) - WS.smc (CRC32: D63ED5F8)
Super Metroid (JU) [!] (UH) - WS.bps
Super Metroid (JU) [!] (UH) - WS.bso
Put the three files in the same folder and open your smc game with bsnes_hd.exe

Or apply the Widescreen bps patch to Super Metroid (JU) [!] (UH).smc with a bps patcher like beat and rename it the same as the bso override file, for example:
Super Metroid (JU) [!] (UH) - WS Patched.smc (CRC32: E76A23D2)
Super Metroid (JU) [!] (UH) - WS Patched.bso
Put only the two files in the same folder, no bps patch here, and open your smc game with bsnes_hd.exe

The RetroArch core bsnes-hd now support softpatch and the bso override file.
